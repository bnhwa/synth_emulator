# Synth_Emulator-ESP32 

This library is made by me to turn an ESP32 into a fully functional polytonic synth with flexible wave shaping abilities and complex song structuring. You can turn an esp32 with a single cheap piezzo buzzer basically into a full-fledged synth!

## Features

Polyphony--play up to as many notes at once,

Real-time speed adjustment,

Complex note scheduling--the sky is the limit

ADSR Envelopes/ structuring

### TODO:

minor bug fixes when ADSR sustain is zero

Perhaps add compression for notes

## Installation and Requirements:

1. Nothing but this library is needed to make this work, as well as one speaker.
2. Clone`https://github.com/bnhwa/synth_emulator`
3. Arduino needs to be installed. Go [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) to download the latest version. Open the Arduino IDE and follow the instructions [here](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/getting-started-with-esp32/) to configure Arduino for the ESP32 and download the ESP32 board configuration. 

4. After downloading this library, either as a folder or in .zip form, go in the Arduino IDE and go to `Sketch->Include Library->Add .zip Library`  and select the library. Voila, now it is ready for use.
