# Synth_Emulator-ESP32 

This library is made by me to turn an ESP32 into a fully functional polytonic synth with flexible wave shaping abilities and complex song structuring. You can turn an esp32 with a single cheap piezzo buzzer basically into a full-fledged synth!

## Features

Polyphony--play up to as many notes at once,

Real-time speed adjustment,

Complex note scheduling--the sky is the limit

ADSR Envelopes/ structuring

### TODO:

minor bug fixes when ADSR sustain is zero
